## Conditioned 3D Deep Kriging with Locally Varying Anisotropy
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for performing both Conditioned 3D DeepKriging (C-DK) and C-DK with Locally Varying Anisotropy (LVA) on a 3D copper (Cu) example.

C-DK 3D-Nested CV.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the expansion of DK into 3D and the integration of Locally Dependent Moments (LDM) to accurately reproduce observed values at sampled locations without increasing the computational burden. 

C-DK+LVA 3D-Nested CV.ipynb introduces the addition of locally varying anisotropy (LVA), enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to represent complex geological features by incorporating LVA.
